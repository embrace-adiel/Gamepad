# HidHide

HidHide configuration client is a filter driver than can "hide" Gamepads/joysticks devices, ensuring Windows and other applications stop detecting it as a game controller and allowing only chosen applications to see them.

# ViGEmBus
Virtual Gamepad Emulation Framework (ViGEm) The ViGEmBus driver and ViGEmClient libraries represent the core of the Virtual Gamepad Emulation Framework (or ViGEm , for short). ViGEm aims for a 100% accurate emulation of well-known gaming peripherals as pure software-based devices at kernel level.

# XOutput
XOutput is a software that can convert DirectInput into XInput. DirectInput data is read and sent to a virtual XInput (Xbox 360 Controller) device.
